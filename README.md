# MinProg_Project

## Project proposal
My project centers upon public spending in the EU. Using data from the Directorate General for Budget a visualization is made showing where the money goes. This will be done from different perspectives;
1. Country perspective: showing what funds gives money to a country (select country > see the different funds)
2. Funds perspective: select a fund and see where the money goes to (both on a bar chart and map)
The aim is to clarify some common misconceptions about EU spending. Therefore it is not only possible to explore the data, but also a set of stories will be shown. ie. "The EU is costing a lot of money" after which a comparison a shown between GDP and contribution to the EU.

1. Features
	* Minimum Viable Product
	* Map showing where money goes (choloropleth)
	* Barchart showing the amount of € per category
	* Choosing if you want to use countries or funds as categories

* Optional
	* Selecting different categories for comparison (search/click)
	* Some premade stories about EU spending
	* Linechart showing historical data
	* Integrating data from the big EU investment funds
	* Table for data exploration
	* Integrating other data (such as GDP?)

2. Problem Solving
	transparancy about eu spending
	tell stories about common misconceptions?

7. Sotential problems and solutions

8. Similar
Openspending.org has a similar dataset. This is however só big that it is almost unusable. Very lowlevel data is making finding data very hard
